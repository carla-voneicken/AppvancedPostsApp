## 📱 Posts App

A simple iOS practice project to apply my learnings from the [Appvanced](https://www.app-entwickler-werden.de/) course on software architecture, repositories, and network calls.

### 🧠 About the Project

Posts App displays a list of users and their corresponding posts, fetching data from the [JSON Placeholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)

It is written in **Swift** and uses **Alamofire** to handle network requests efficiently.

This project demonstrates key concepts such as:
- Clean architectural structure (use cases, repositories, network layer)
- API integration with asynchronous data handling
- Separation of concerns and scalability in app design

### 🛠️ Built With

- Swift
- Alamofire
- SwiftUI
- Xcode

### 🌍 API Source

Data provided by [JSON Placeholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
